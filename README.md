A wireless bone conduction headset based on the ESP32, designed to fit inside of a hat. Currently stuck in prototyping phase due to the semiconductor shortage. Although, a 3d printed clip seems to be a next step due to the less than optimal placing on the inside of the hat. As for the board itself, I'd like to get the DAC onto the main board instead of having a secondary board attatched to the main one via pin headers.
